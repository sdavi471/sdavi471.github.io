        <h2>Wife, Mom of Four, and Full-Time Homemaker</h2>
        
         <p> Hey there! My name is Stephanie and I live in Minnesota, where my love for winter and 
             snow fits right into everyday life. My husband and I are coming up on our 10-year 
             anniversary, and together we’re raising four kiddos in a home that’s always full of 
             energy. I enjoy staying active — whether I’m playing volleyball or pickleball, tubing behind a boat 
             in the summer, or skiing in the winter.</p>
         <p>
            I attended Bob Jones University back in the early 2010s for cosmetology. I currently
            have a small salon in my home, and have saved our family thousands of dollars on free
            haircuts! I am currently back in school at Bob Jones University, taking classes online
            and working towards an Associate's Degree in Liveral Arts. I am excited to say that I have
            almost completed my first semester back to school! Attending school with very young kids is
            not the easiest choice that one could make, but the Lord is faithfully seeing me through!
