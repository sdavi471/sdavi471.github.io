        <h1>Stephanie Davis</h1>
        <h2>Liberal Arts Major, Bob Jones University</h2>
        
         <p>       Hi! I’m Stephanie, and I call Minnesota home—a perfect fit for someone who genuinely 
            loves winter and snow. My husband and I are celebrating our 10-year anniversary soon,
            and together we’re raising four energetic kiddos who keep our home lively and full of joy.</p>
        <p>        I enjoy staying active and outdoors whenever I can. Whether I’m playing volleyball or 
            pickleball, tubing behind a boat in the summer, or skiing through Minnesota winters, I love 
            finding ways to move and have fun.</p>
        <p>       I originally attended Bob Jones University in the early 2010s, studying cosmetology. Today, 
            I have a small salon out of my home, which has saved our family countless dollars in 
            haircuts and lets me keep my skills alive. I’m also back in school at BJU, working toward an 
            Associate’s Degree in Liberal Arts through online classes. I’m excited to be nearing the end 
            of my first semester back! Balancing coursework with very young children definitely hasn’t 
            been easy, but the Lord has been faithful every step of the way.
